This is a simple better UI search engine for the Sparkvue exploit originally found in 2024 or even earlier idk.

NOTE: I do not consent to your dumb self, if you get this exploit gone. don't come crying to me. Because IDC!


Also thanks to ohonbob for finding this beautiful exploit, and Amurkess for the Idea.
